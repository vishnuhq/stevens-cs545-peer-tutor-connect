# Peer-Tutor Connect
Peer-Tutor Connect is a web application that enables real-time, course-specific peer-to-peer micro-tutoring, mainly for online courses that encourage collaborative learning. In such courses, students often face delays in getting help from instructors or TAs, which interrupts study flow and creates frustration. This platform addresses the problem by letting students log in with their student credentials, join their course groups, and use a shared dashboard to post concise “blocker” questions and reply within threads, ensuring others with the same question can quickly find resolution. Students may choose to post with their name or remain anonymous, allowing them to comfortably seek conceptual help without fear of judgment, while the system emphasizes Efficiency as the primary “E” by minimizing wait times for support.
